X-RayVision is a deep learning-based project aimed at detecting COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. It leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify X-rays into three categories: COVID-19, Normal, and Viral Pneumonia. The project showcases the power of AI in medical diagnostics, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Project Overview
The **X-RayVision** project aims to assist in the rapid detection of COVID-19 using chest X-ray images. The system is designed to classify X-rays into three distinct categories: COVID-19, Normal, and Viral Pneumonia. This tool can support healthcare workers by automating the diagnostic process.

### Key Features:
- Classifies chest X-ray images into three categories: COVID-19, Normal, and Viral Pneumonia.
- Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classification.
- Preprocesses and augments images to improve model accuracy.
- Displays results using a confusion matrix and ROC curve.

## Tech Stack
The following technologies and libraries were used in this project:

- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow**  
- **Keras**  
- **OpenCV**  
- **NumPy**  
- **Scikit-learn**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **OS module**  
- **CV2 module**  
- **VS Code**

## Dataset
The dataset includes chest X-ray images divided into three categories:
1. COVID-19
2. Normal
3. Viral Pneumonia

The dataset can be obtained from [public repositories](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and organized in the following directory structure:

```
COVID-19_Radiography_Dataset/
│
├── COVID/
│   └── images/
├── Normal/
│   └── images/
└── Viral Pneumonia/
    └── images/
```

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/X-RayVision.git
    cd X-RayVision
    ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure your dataset is placed in the correct folder structure mentioned above.

## Usage
1. Run the project by executing the `main.py` file:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. The model will start training on the dataset and perform classification.

3. After training, the model will display the test accuracy and predictions.

## Model Architecture
The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The architecture consists of the following layers:

- **Convolutional Layers**: Feature extraction from images.
- **MaxPooling Layers**: Downsampling feature maps.
- **Dense (Fully Connected) Layers**: Classification.
- **Dropout Layers**: Preventing overfitting.

### Sample Model Code:
```python
model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(224, 224, 1)))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(3, activation='softmax'))
```

## Results
The model is evaluated using several performance metrics, including:

- **Accuracy**: Measured on the test dataset.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Displayed for classification performance.
- **ROC Curve**: Shows the model's ability to distinguish between classes.

### Sample Prediction Visualization:
```python
for i in range(5):
    plt.imshow(X_test[i].reshape(224, 224), cmap='gray')
    plt.title(f"Prediction: {categories[np.argmax(predictions[i])]}, Actual: {categories[np.argmax(y_test[i])]}")
    plt.show()
```
